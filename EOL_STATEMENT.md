# End of Life Statement

So the time has come to say goodbye to ArchonCrates. üò¢

ArchonCrates was not the first plugin I developed but was certainly my biggest and favourite but all things must come to an end and 
it has been a long time coming. You may have noticed that I wasn't releasing updates nor have I been activly working on the plugin for 
a while and this was due to a few reasons. First of in 2016, 1 year after I released ArchonCrates I finished school and started working
full time which as you can imaging takes up a lot of time. Alongside working I also was trying to start my own development company which
I did in 2017 and you may have saw since I was developing ArchonCrates under the company name "HamiStudios". So both combined took a lot
of my time away from ArchonCrates.

Now with all that said I never forgot about ArchonCrates it was always in the back of my mind and I was constantly thinking what I could
do next with the project but never got around to doing it with the limited time. This is the main reason all the issues went unresolved
etc. I have honestly had sleepless nights thinking what I could do with ArchonCrates.

I have been wanting to do this for a while now but just never got around to doing it because I never really wanted to let go of the project
but I think that is whats best. I am going to archive the repository but if anyone wants to take ownership of the plugin please contact
me so we can talk about it (email: sean[at]hamistudios.com) or if anyone wants to fork the project feel free I am going to release all code
under MIT.

I hope everyone understands my decision, ArchonCrates truly changed my life and I will never forget it ‚ù§
