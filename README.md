## Developers

ArchonCrates contains a very powerful and useful API for developers. We designed the API to allow developers to add their own features and extend the plugin to their will along with keeping it really easy and usable.
You can view the API source [here](https://github.com/hammy2899/ArchonCrates/tree/master/src/com/HamiStudios/ArchonCrates/API) and the Java Docs [here](https://archoncrates.com/docs/19-0-1/api/index.html).

We also have some big plans for the plugin which will expand the posabiltys for developers even more, stay tuned! :tada:
